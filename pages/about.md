## Manas Sahni
{:style="text-align:center"}

Hi! I'm an incoming MS CS student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/).

From 2017-2019, I was a Sotfware Engineer at Samsung Research Bangalore, where I worked on the intersection of machine learning & computing systems, exploring challenges in efficiently running heavy neural networks on low-power devices. This blog, _efficieNN_, is where I'll be writing about what I'm learning along the way.

I like to learn new things & explain them, and talk peopleâ€™s ears off about work I find interesting
